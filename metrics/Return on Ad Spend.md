## Formula
`Ad Revenue / Ad Spend = ROAS`
- Ad Revenue = revenue generated by advertisement spending, in currency
- Ad Spend = cost of advertisement spending, in currency

This ratio is expressed as a percentage. 100% means each dollar in advertising created a dollar in sales. 200% means each dollar in advertising created 2 dollars in sales. Higher percentages are better and indicate more effective advertising.
