## üëã Purpose
The Open Metrics Project is designed to **accelerate and improve our combined knowledge of metrics** definitions, applications, and understanding.

The Open Metrics Project is a free and open collection that strives to serve as a foundation to **business leaders and data practitioners**.

## Motivation
My vision for the Open Metrics Project is for anyone applying data analytics to solve problems to make massive impact quickly, by providing a foundation and reference for any type of analysis.

The data analytics industry is undergoing massive innovation. Unfortunately, many practitioners get so caught up in tools, products, architectures, and performance, that we forget about simply applying all this tech to make business impact. 

Until OMP, there was no resource for business leaders and various data practitioner roles to speak a common language and understand one another. There was no library to learn about common (or not so common) metrics in any given industry.
